## Bug #1. The handleDrop() function needs to add the draggedPiece to the drop zone by appending it as a child element of the drop zone. This is missing from the current code.

## Bug #2. The changeBGImage() function needs to make sure that the backgroundImage URL is surrounded by quotes to prevent errors if the URL contains spaces
